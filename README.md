I'd be glad to create a definition for a GitHub repository that implements push and pull functionality using raycasting in Unreal Engine C++:</br>
</br>
Repository Name: UE4-PushPull</br>
</br>
Description: This project demonstrates character interaction with dynamic objects in Unreal Engine 4 using C++. The character can push and pull objects within reach by holding the 'F' key and performing a raycast to detect them.</br>
</br>
Features:</br>
</br>
Raycasting: The character performs a line trace (Unreal Engine's term for raycast) from the camera's direction to detect dynamic objects in the world.</br>
Push/Pull: While holding the 'F' key, the character can push or pull the detected object based on its position relative to the character.</br>
Dynamic Object Handling: The code focuses on pushing and pulling dynamic objects, ensuring they react to physics simulations.</br>
Clear Code Structure: The code is well-organized and commented to enhance readability and maintainability.</br>
Folder Structure:</br>
</br>
Characters:
Character class header file.</br>
Character class implementation file.</br>
</br>
